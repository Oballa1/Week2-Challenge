Description
There are three different codes for three different functions. I.e

Case.js 
The provided code snippet comprises three functions: toUpperCase, toLowerCase, and invertCase. These functions are designed to manipulate the case of characters within a string. toUpperCase and toLowerCase perform straightforward conversions of a string to uppercase and lowercase, respectively, utilizing JavaScript's built-in methods. The invertCase function serves as the core functionality, splitting the input string into an array of characters, iterating over each character to determine its case,converting uppercase to lowercase and vice versa. Finally, the modified characters are rejoined into a single string and returned.

display.js 
The provided code defines a function named getArray designed to generate an array containing numbers between two specified values (val1 and val2). Inside the function, an empty array arr is initialized to store the numbers within the specified range. Using a for loop, the function iterates from val1 + 1 up to val2 - 1, pushing each number within this range into the arr array. Finally, the function returns the populated array containing the numbers between val1 and val2, excluding the boundary values themselves. This function serves as a concise utility for generating sequences of numbers within a specified range, facilitating tasks requiring such numeric sequences.

3 prime.js 
The provided code presents a function called getPrime intended to extract prime numbers from an input array of numbers. Inside the function, it initializes an empty array named result to hold the prime numbers found. Through iteration over each value in the input array, the function checks if the current value meets the conditions for being a prime number. These conditions include not being divisible by 2 or 3, excluding the value 1, and including the values 2 and 3. If a value satisfies these criteria, it is considered prime and added to the result array. Finally, the function returns the array containing the identified prime numbers. However, the code snippet concludes with an attempt to call the getPrime function with an undefined array variable, array, which may result in an error unless a valid array is provided beforehand.
